# Usage

All Python scripts require at least Python 2.7. Help for utilities is located in directory [utilities/](utilities/).

### benchmark.py

This script performs the evaluation of the tools specified in `tools.py` file on a given dataset.

Please check the directory `sample` for sample output.

> Complete `tools.py` documentation will be available sometimes later. The most of the file schema is pretty much self-explanatory. Just make sure that all tools are stored in `tools` directory (i.e. `cmd` parameter is evaluated as `tools/${cmd}`).

#### Parameters:

 - `--input/-i <file>`

    `<file>` denotes input FASTQ or SAM file. File type should be auto-detected.

 - `--ref/-r <reference>`

    Path to reference FASTA file. Some tools require pre-processed reference. Please check `ref.py` for details.

 - `--threads/-t <list>`

    Specify how many different thread configurations you want to evaluate. Default is `1` (evaluate in single-threaded mode). Different threads are separated with comma.

 - `--force/-f`

    If enabled, do not resume the experiment, but repeat it again. This will overwrite the previous logs.

 - `--copy/-c`

    Copy the input files in the current directory. Useful if your data is on NFS drives.
    
    **BUG WARNING**: for paired-end data, you will need to manually copy second paired-end file. We plan to update our script to do this automatically later.

 - `--rt/-R`

    Use `SCHED_FIFO` real-time priority via `chrt`. Requires root permissions.

 - `--clear-cache/-C`

    Clear file system cache before every experiment. Requires root.

 - `--output-dir/-o`

    Move successfully compressed and decompressed files to the another directory. Useful if the main hard disk is not large enough to keep all the files. By default, nothing is moved.

 - `--email/-e <address>`

    Send an e-mail detailing th ebenchmark process when the script is completed.

#### Examples:

 -  `$ ref.py test.fa`

    Prepares the reference file `test.fa`.

    `# benchmark.py -i test_sam.sam -r test.fa -C -e test@localhost -t 1,4`

    Evaluates `test_fq.sam` with reference `test.fa` in single-threaded and 4-threaded mode. Disk cache will be cleared before invocation of each tool (root is required for this to work). After the completion, log will be mailed to `test@localhost`.

 - `$ benchmark.py -i test_fq.sam -r test.fa`

    Evaluates `test_fq.fq` with reference file `test.fa` in single-threaded mode. No e-mail will be sent.


### ref.py

This script will prepare the references for the following tools:

 - Any tool requiring indexed reference (`ref.fai`)
 - sam_comp (`ref.sc`)
 - CBC (`ref.cbc`)

It requires Samtools to be available in `PATH`.

#### Invocation:

    ref.py <reference.fa>
