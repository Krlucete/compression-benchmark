This is a set of scripts used for measuring the performance of high-throughput sequencing compression tools (i.e. tools compressing FASTQ or SAM files).

## Tutorials

Please refer to the following documents for a detailed guide how to run benchmarks yourself.

- [Benchmarking Quickstart](aws.md)
- [Usage](usage.md)
- [Data Samples](samples.md)
- [Tools](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/compression-benchmark-tools/)

A comprehensive database of available benchmarks is available [here](https://sfu-compbio.github.io/compression-benchmark-data/).

Data dumps are available at [compression-benchmark-data repository](https://github.com/sfu-compbio/compression-benchmark-data)
